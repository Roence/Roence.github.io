                                    <strong> Reimagine. Recreate. Restore</strong>


                                    ecosystem restoration : preventing, halting and reversing the damage, from exploiting nature to healing it.
                                    Ecosystem restoration can take many forms: <strong>Growing trees</strong>, greening cities, rewilding gardens, changing diets or cleaning up rivers and coasts. This is the generation that can make peace with nature. 
                                    Source:<a href="www.unep.org"> www.unep.org</a> and <a href="www.en.unesco.org">www.en.unesco.org.</a> </br>
                                    
                                    With this project, our aim is to promote ecologically sound land use and natural resource management through green enterprises for improved livelihoods.
                                    And it is in our plan to have young people within the region to plant 175,000 trees in the span of 5 years with your support. 
                                    Project priorities are based on challenges faced by the Environment and Natural Resources sector in Uganda and globally and aspirations in 
                                    the policies governing environment and natural resources management. We focus on using a Communication, Education, Public Awareness approach 
                                    and demonstration of strategies to cause positive change in attitude, 
                                    mindset and behavior to deliver the desired development needs of people while maintaining healthy nature’s life support systems. 

                                </br> This move also, promotes --> “Forest restoration: a path to recovery and well-being”. Restoring forests helps build a healthier world for ourselves
                                        and for future generations. 
                                        By replanting and managing forests sustainably, we can help preserve our planet’s biodiversity and 
                                        combat climate change while fostering economic activity that creates jobs and improves lives as we enter the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).

                                   Chilli is one of the growing most valuable crop in Uganda and East Africa as a whole. The crop is grown largely for its fruits all over the country
                                   . It is used in Uganda as a principal ingredient of various curries and it is also used for Vegetables, spices, condiments etc.Dry chillies are used
                                   for curry powder. This is a promising venture and so, having young people in the area engaged in growing it and connecting them to direct market is 
                                 creating impact and improving their economic status.

                                    communities, as trees planted on farms provide timber, fuelwood, fodder,

                                    At present the need to plant trees on farms is on the increase. It is difficult,
                                    however, for smallholders to access – at the right time, in the right quantities
                                    and of high quality – the trees that they want to plant. In order to meet
                                    present and future demand for planting material, there is a need to promote
                                    on-farm and community tree nurseries. Such nurseries can be owned and
                                    managed by youths in groups, by self-help groups, by schools, by churches
                                    and/or by a range of other local institutions. They provide income-generating
                                    opportunities, act as models for further nursery development, provide
                                    seedlings more cheaply to planters, and can raise the particular species that
                                    local people are interested in.
                                    In order for young people to establish effective nurseries enterprises, it
                                    is important to provide these young people with the simple technical
                                    information and a capital they need for establishment and management of facilities. This is
                                    the role of this Roence.

                                    Kole District is primarily an agrarian economy with a moderate illiteracy rate. However, because of current agricultural practices,
                                    environmental factors and unavailability of large farming areas, Kole being a plateau area with quite a number of swamps, agriculture is primarily subsistence. 
                                    People are not able to generate sufficient income out of agriculture as they do not invest much capital in it. Hence, along with agriculture, 
                                    animal husbandry is inherent to the community. Pig rearing in the backyard of houses is not common for the Kole people yet in it, there lies a secret treasure, that's why we 
                                    introduced this as one of the projects for young people to engage into.
                                     Pork is the most relished food in the region. However, the demand and supply gap is huge as there are not many pig rearing centers and especially during 
                                     the festive seasons of Christmas and New Year hence making the prices soar high. Pork is normally sold at higher prices in Lango because of huge demand. 
                                    On normal days retail prices are around UGX.14,000/kg which soars to about 16,000 - 18,000/kg in the festive season. It's is why it is such a lucrative project for young people to engage into.

                                    Where formal job opportunities are few, running a small business or being self-employed is a key way to support oneself and one’s household. 
                                    In this context the absence of appropriate 
                                    financial services to start or grow a business is a huge barrier to young people, as is their lack of relevant skills.
                                    Therefore, the challenge is finding effective, scalable ways to overcome these barriers. How can we give young people access
                                     to the financial services and skills they need to be able to support themselves economically? Addressing youth financial
                                      inclusion will be key to realizing Goal 8 of the SDGs: 
                                     ‘Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.’ 

                                     Skilling young people with different skillsets like Liquid Soap making helps give them opportunities to have grow economically and help sort the issue of employment by creating themselves such enterprises.

                                    Rabbit farming is known as cuniculture. It is low costable farming and has alternative breeding methods.  
                                    Additionally, the interesting part is that they
                                     are a family-friendly animal.  Raising rabbits as a pet or grow them for meat both can be profitable. 
                                    However, our purpose of raising through identified youths; is majorly to improve the livelihood of farmers and thus eradicating poverty out of the
